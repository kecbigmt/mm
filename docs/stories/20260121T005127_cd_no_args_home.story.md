## Story Log

### Goal
Enable `mm cd` without arguments to navigate to home (today's date placement), matching bash cd behavior.

### Why
Currently, `mm cd` without arguments shows the current working directory (like `pwd`). This is inconsistent with standard bash behavior where `cd` without arguments returns to the home directory. Users expect `cd` to navigate home, providing a quick way to return to today's context.

### User Story
**As a mm user, I want `mm cd` without arguments to navigate to today's date placement, so that I can quickly return to my daily context following familiar bash conventions.**

### Acceptance Criteria

#### 1. Home Navigation
- [ ] **Given** the current working directory is any placement, **When** you run `mm cd` without arguments, **Then** the CWD is changed to today's date placement (YYYY-MM-DD) and the new location is displayed

#### 2. Display Behavior
- [ ] **Given** you run `mm cd` without arguments, **When** navigation succeeds, **Then** the output displays the new placement (today's date)

#### 3. Timezone Awareness
- [ ] **Given** the workspace has a configured timezone, **When** you run `mm cd` without arguments, **Then** "today" is calculated using the workspace timezone, not system timezone

#### 4. Edge Cases
- [ ] **Given** today's date container does not exist yet, **When** you run `mm cd` without arguments, **Then** the CWD is still set to today's date placement (container will be created when needed)

#### 5. Backward Compatibility
- [ ] **Given** the workspace option is provided, **When** you run `mm cd -w <workspace>` without path argument, **Then** navigation uses the specified workspace's timezone and state

### Verification Approach
Direct CLI command execution with assertions on output and state changes:
1. Check current CWD with `mm pwd`
2. Navigate to different location (e.g., `mm cd yesterday`)
3. Run `mm cd` without arguments
4. Verify output shows today's date
5. Verify `mm pwd` confirms CWD is today's date
6. Test with different workspace timezones

### Out of Scope
- Changing behavior of `mm cd` with path arguments (already works correctly)
- Adding a separate "home" concept beyond today's date
- Configurable home directory (today's date is the home)
- Displaying current directory without changing it (use `mm pwd` instead)
