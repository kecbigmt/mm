## Story Log

### Goal
Enable `mm cd` without arguments to navigate to home (today's date placement), matching bash cd behavior.

### Why
Currently, `mm cd` without arguments shows the current working directory (like `pwd`). This is inconsistent with standard bash behavior where `cd` without arguments returns to the home directory. Users expect `cd` to navigate home, providing a quick way to return to today's context.

### User Story
**As a mm user, I want `mm cd` without arguments to navigate to today's date placement, so that I can quickly return to my daily context following familiar bash conventions.**

### Acceptance Criteria

#### 1. Home Navigation
- [x] **Given** the current working directory is any placement, **When** you run `mm cd` without arguments, **Then** the CWD is changed to today's date placement (YYYY-MM-DD) and the new location is displayed

#### 2. Display Behavior
- [x] **Given** you run `mm cd` without arguments, **When** navigation succeeds, **Then** the output displays the new placement (today's date)

#### 3. Timezone Awareness
- [x] **Given** the workspace has a configured timezone, **When** you run `mm cd` without arguments, **Then** "today" is calculated using the workspace timezone, not system timezone

#### 4. Edge Cases
- [x] **Given** today's date container does not exist yet, **When** you run `mm cd` without arguments, **Then** the CWD is still set to today's date placement (container will be created when needed)

#### 5. Backward Compatibility
- [x] **Given** the workspace option is provided, **When** you run `mm cd -w <workspace>` without path argument, **Then** navigation uses the specified workspace's timezone and state

### Verification Approach
Direct CLI command execution with assertions on output and state changes:
1. Check current CWD with `mm pwd`
2. Navigate to different location (e.g., `mm cd yesterday`)
3. Run `mm cd` without arguments
4. Verify output shows today's date
5. Verify `mm pwd` confirms CWD is today's date
6. Test with different workspace timezones

### Out of Scope
- Changing behavior of `mm cd` with path arguments (already works correctly)
- Adding a separate "home" concept beyond today's date
- Configurable home directory (today's date is the home)
- Displaying current directory without changing it (use `mm pwd` instead)

---

### Completed Work Summary

**Implementation completed.**

1. Modified `src/presentation/cli/commands/cd.ts` to navigate to today's date when no path argument is provided
2. Added `computeTodayInTimezone()` helper function to calculate today's date in workspace timezone
3. Created comprehensive E2E tests in `tests/e2e/scenarios/scenario_08_cd_home_navigation_test.ts`

**Key changes:**
- When `mm cd` is called without arguments, it now navigates to today's date (matching bash behavior) instead of displaying the current directory
- Uses `Intl.DateTimeFormat` with workspace timezone to determine "today"
- Displays the new placement after navigation

### Acceptance Checks

**Status: Ready for Review**

Developer verification completed:
- E2E tests pass for all acceptance criteria
- Full test suite passes (environment-specific shell completion tests excluded)
- Merged latest main and resolved conflicts with new `CwdResolutionService` API

### Follow-ups / Open Risks

#### Addressed
- None

#### Remaining
- Performance optimization: `computeTodayInTimezone` creates new `Intl.DateTimeFormat` instance on each call. Consider using shared module from `feature-fix-pwd-permanent-placement` (story: `20260121T100816_timezone-format-optimization.story.md`) when available
