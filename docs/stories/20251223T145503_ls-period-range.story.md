## Story Log

### Goal
Make `mm ls this-week` and `mm ls this-month` display items for the entire period, not just the first day.

### Why
Currently, `mm ls this-week` only shows items from Monday (the start of the week) and `mm ls this-month` only shows items from the 1st of the month. Users expect these commands to show all items within the specified period - all weekdays for `this-week` and all days for `this-month`.

### User Story
**As a mm user, I want `mm ls this-week` to list items from Monday to Sunday and `mm ls this-month` to list items from the 1st to the last day, so that I can see all items in the specified period with a single command.**

### Acceptance Criteria

#### 1. this-week Range
- [ ] **Given** today is any day of the week, **When** running `mm ls this-week`, **Then** it displays items from Monday to Sunday of the current week
- [ ] **Given** today is any day of the week, **When** running `mm ls tw` (alias), **Then** it behaves the same as `this-week`
- [ ] **Given** items exist on different days, **When** running `mm ls this-week`, **Then** all items from Mon-Sun appear grouped by date

#### 2. next-week / last-week Range
- [ ] **Given** today is any day, **When** running `mm ls next-week`, **Then** it displays items from Monday to Sunday of the next week
- [ ] **Given** today is any day, **When** running `mm ls last-week`, **Then** it displays items from Monday to Sunday of the previous week

#### 3. this-month Range
- [ ] **Given** today is any day of December 2025, **When** running `mm ls this-month`, **Then** it displays items from December 1st to December 31st
- [ ] **Given** today is in February of a leap year, **When** running `mm ls this-month`, **Then** it correctly handles the 29-day month

#### 4. next-month / last-month Range
- [ ] **Given** today is December 2025, **When** running `mm ls next-month`, **Then** it displays items from January 1st to January 31st (2026)
- [ ] **Given** today is March 2025, **When** running `mm ls last-month`, **Then** it displays items from February 1st to February 28th

#### 5. Backward Compatibility
- [ ] **Given** `this-week` used in a non-range context (e.g., `mm add task "foo" --due this-week`), **When** executing, **Then** it still resolves to the single start date (Monday)

### Out of Scope
- Changing behavior of relative weekday syntax (`next-monday`, `last-friday`)
- Changing the `..` range syntax (e.g., `today..+7d`)

### Acceptance Checks

**Status: Pending Product Owner Review**

Developer verification completed:
- [List what the developer manually verified]
- [Note any observations or findings]

**Awaiting product owner acceptance testing before marking this user story as complete.**

### Follow-ups / Open Risks

#### Addressed
- Week range scope: Mon-Sun (full week) per user preference

#### Remaining
- Design decision: Where to implement the range expansion (date_resolver vs path_parser)?
