Always read **AGENTS.md** before taking any action.

1. **Project root `AGENTS.md`**  
   - Always read this file first.  
   - It defines the global rules and policies for the entire project.

2. **Local `AGENTS.md`**  
   - If there is an `AGENTS.md` file in the current working directory or any related folder,  
     read it as well and apply it on top of the root one (override or extend as needed).
