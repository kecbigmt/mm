# mm CLI

mm is a personal knowledge management CLI that stores notes and tasks as Markdown and JSON files. The tool organises content as a graph of container and item nodes, keeping immutable on-disk locations while managing logical placements through edges and ranks.

## Getting Started

```sh
deno task dev
```

Use `deno task test` to run the full unit test suite.

## Documentation

Domain and product design notes live in `docs/steering/design.md`.
